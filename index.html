      <blockquote>
        But web browsers aren’t like web servers. If your back-end code is
        getting so big that it’s starting to run noticably slowly, you can throw
        more computing power at it by scaling up your server. That’s not an
        option on the front-end where you don’t really have
        <em>one</em> run-time environment—your end users have their own run-time
        environment with its own constraints around computing power
        <strong>and</strong> network connectivity.
